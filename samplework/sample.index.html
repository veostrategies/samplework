            COLLEMC @UMICH.EDU</div>

        <p>I am a Lecturer IV in the School of Information at the <a href= "umich.edu" University of Michigan> </a>. I focus on the introductory
            programming
            courses such as Data-Oriented Programming (SI 206) and the Web Design Courses (SI 339 and SI 539).</p>

        <p>My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/" California State University> </a> and positions at NASA JPL, the
            Naval
            Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from Kent State University Honors College in Computer Science,
            and an MS
            and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial
            Intelligence
            applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.</p>

        <p>My honors include being chosen as a National Physical Sciences Consortium Fellow and a NASA Faculty Fellow.
            I have
            always emphasized the idea of technology for everybody. To that I have worked to create courses for
            education majors to
            learn robotics, as well other CS curriculum for non-majors. Her current focus is outreach with elementary
            and middle
            school students to learn problem-solving, coding, and design. I have published three recent books for
            children, "Web
            Design with HTML" and more "Web Design with HTML" and "Making a Web Page" (co-authored with my son).</p>
