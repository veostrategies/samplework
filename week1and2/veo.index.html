        What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? 
        Search Engine Optimization is the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.
    </p>

        <p>
        What is Voice-based Search Engine Optimization (VEO)?
        Once a web site is optimized for the essentials of (SEO), Voice-based search engine optimization (VEO) can be practiced. VEO includes the process of using conversational artificial intelligence (AI), by vocally or manually submitting a question, fragments of words, and or request. Once the submission is queried, the conversational AI will provide the most accurate and dominant answer/result to the individual submitting the query. VEO includes back-end SEO, machine learning, and conversational AI.

        How does machine learning in search work? 
    </p>
        
        <p>
        Before moving forward and thinking of machine learning we must understand how search engines crawl, and index websites. We must understand how search engine algorithms function. 
    </p>

        <p>
        Search engines treat user intent as ranking signals. We must know of their importance. 
    </p>

        <p>
        What is user intent? 
        User Intent 
        
        User intent or query intent is the identification and categorization of what a user online intended or wanted when they typed their search terms into an online web search engine for the purpose of search engine optimization or conversion rate optimization. Also referenced at times as query intent. 
        
        How does machine learning actually impact search and seo? 
        
        We first must understand what Machine Learning is.
        
        Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.
        
        Machine learning is not the same as artificial intelligence (AI).
        
        AI is the science behind creating systems that resemble human-like intelligence and process information in a similar manner. AI is also unpredictable in many ways. Regarding SEO/VEO the AI will be able to add new data and calculate new techniques depending on what is required from the search engine. 
        
        We use machine learning to solve problems. Machine Learning works mathematically to produce the SEO techniques and solutions. 
        
        Google’s search engine’s primary algorithm is RankBrain.
        RankBrain is an algorithm learning artificial intelligence system, the use of which was confirmed by Google on 26 October 2015. It helps Google to process search results and provide more relevant search results for users.
        
        The machine learning aspect of RankBrain is what sets it apart from other updates. To “teach” the RankBrain algorithm to produce useful search results, Google first “feeds” it’s data from a variety of sources. The algorithm then takes it from there, calculating and teaching itself over time to match a variety of signals to a variety of results and to order search engine rankings based on these calculations.
        
        Google’s core algorithm which uses machine learning (the ability of machines to teach themselves from data inputs) to determine the most relevant results to search engine queries. Pre-RankBrain, Google utilized its basic algorithm to determine which results to show for a given query. Post-RankBrain, it is believed that the query now goes through an interpretation model that can apply possible factors like the location of the searcher, personalization, and the words of the query to determine the searcher’s true intent. By discerning this true intent, Google can deliver more relevant results.

        <p>
        How do we comply with Google’s RankBrain?
        
        Here are 4 ways for marketers to comply and win with RankBrain’s ranking system:
        
        RankBrain prefers natural long-tail keyword phrases, which sound like smartphone voice searches – or the real questions that searchers ask or seek. RankBrain connects the dots between the search terms and the keyword phrases to guide users to website content matching the search request. Marketers using long-tail queries as their keyword phrases get RankBrains’s attention. A clear, concise and conclusive keyword strategy with primary keywords and associated long-tail phrases and queries conveying the content topic, is easily interpreted by RankBrain, leading to a highly ranked website in SERP.

        2.  It is now advisable to use Google AdWords Keyword Planner – a valuable tool that identifies the exact and apt keyword phrases to build relevant content. It generates a list that a marketer will find helpful to review and determine the essential vital topics around which meaningful content can be created. Using these keyword phrase suggestions provided by Google can help in understanding how the search engine links the questions. Moreover, content with Google-suggested keyword phrases will get better RankBrain ranking.

        3. Create natural relevance  by writing unique, exciting and fact-based content that flows naturally and (yet strategically) with non-repetitive keywords and links that direct to complementary sources that enhance the idea and insights of the overall content. RankBrain loves content that is created keeping the user intent in mind - that the users will want to find in the websites.

        4. To own organic listings with remarkable click-through rates, it is imperative to tap into the readers’ emotions. Emotions are one of the most powerful triggers that not only increase the clickthrough rate but also boost the conversion rate dramatically. To raise your CTR from ‘OK’ to ‘Great,’ you must combine the best of both worlds – powerful and influential emotional trigger + relevant keyword strategy 
         RankBrain promotes content that is thoughtfully created answering users’ questions and solving their problems while leveraging a particular emotion.
        SEO is evolving each day, and AI and machine learning are adding new dimensions to what’s possible with search. Google has confirmed that RankBrain is continuously being applied to an increasing number of search queries and its AI processes all the questions that Google handles – which has humongous implications for your SEO strategy.

        <p>
        Some of the Factors RankBrain is looking for in ranking a page are
        Organic Click-Through-Rate of the Page
        Session Per User or Dwell Time (Time on-page)
        Bounce Rate (How quickly someone leaves)

        <p>
        HTML coder or back-end developer who wants to know what it is that they should know about SEO. On-site SEO requires more than just an SEO expert. It's a team effort. It means getting multiple people involved, including a designer, and front- and back- end developers. Everyone must understand their role in building a search engine-friendly website. When building a website, these are the roles typically involved:
        The SEO strategist does the keyword research and plans the required landing pages based on what they know of the client's business goals and needs. They provide a list of pages that must be on the website as well as any front-end coding recommendations that are specific to the needs of a particular website.
        The information architect takes that information from the SEO strategist to then integrate that into their IA work for a website that is both usable and search engine-friendly.
        The designer creates an interface that translates the IA wireframes into a well-branded, effective communication tool that can handle the necessary content as specified for SEO purposes. The designer is also partly responsible for ensuring that the fonts they use that are crucial to the SEO project are machine-readable and that the page load time and bounce rates will not be negatively affected by a design element.
        The front-end coder must ensure that content is coded to in a search-engine friendly fashion.
        The back-end developer needs to ensure proper canonicalization of URLs and provide the tools necessary to help with SEO.
        SEO standards for Front-End Coders:
        To make it easy for front-end coders and back-end developers to have a list of items to consider when doing their part of the website building process, I've made a list of standards to go by:
        CSS vs Tables
        This shouldn't require mentioning, but websites should be using CSS rather than a table structure. This allows for improved ordering of content elements on the page. For example, being able to place a long left sidebar below rather than above a block of unique content would be nice. CSS allows that to happen.
        Usage of H tags and other style elements
        Limit the usage of H tags (H1, H2, H3, etc) and <strong> </strong> tags to non-repetitive content. That means don't use these HTML tags on site-wide headings, sidebars, footers, or anything that is repeated across the website or multiple pages. Instead, use a regular div. Reserve these tags for unique content on every page.
        Fonts
        As much as possible, use machine-readable fonts. An alternative is to use font-replacement such as @font-face. As a last resort, use an image to display text. Place the image in an image tag (rather than using CSS) with alt text that repeats what is written in the image, word-for-word.
        Images
        For images that are stylistic elements, using CSS background images is fine, but for content elements, found within a body of text that is unique to a page, use a regular image tag. For logos, use an image tag rather than using text replacement, as seen here. http://css-tricks.com/rethinking-css-image-replacement/  (see "The New Way"). Alt tags should contain the words seen in the image.
        Site speed
        A web page should not take more than 3 seconds to load on a 10Mb connection. The front-end coder is not responsible for the entirety of what makes a page fast or slow, but they do have a role to play. That means consolidating CSS and javascript files, loading javascript at the end of the page, creating sprites and seeking other size-cutting opportunities.
        Making content readable
        Search engines have trouble reading content that is within <script> tags or that loads dynamically (such as AJAX). Anything that does not come loaded as the page loads will most likely not get picked up by search engines. Do not use dynamically loading content unless it is explicitly stated in the website specification document.</script>
        </p>
        <p>
        SEO Standards for Back-End Developers
        Canonicalization
        A canonical URL is the version of any given web page's URL that we want indexed by search engines. Canonicalization is the process by which we achieve that result. Every page on a website should only be accessible from one URL. Additional URL parameters can be added, if handled using techniques described here.
        Dealing with www and index pages.
        By default, all of the following URLs should redirect to www.example.com
        example.com, example.com/index.(.*), www.example.com/index.(.*)
        There may be cases where a website owner prefers to use the non-www version or a subdomain as their root domain. That is fine as long as all other versions redirect to that chosen version.
        Dealing with trailing slashes
        URLs may have a trailing slash "/" at the end. Sometimes they do not. The server should always redirect to one or the other. Ideally, the version with the slash is preferred.
        Example: www.example.com/blue-widget should 301 redirect to www.example.com/blue-widget/
        Note that this is not an issue with root URLs, such as www.example.com. A slash will never appear at the end of that URL.
        Canonicalizing subpages
        A product page on an e-commerce website that is accessible at 3 different URLs is not a good idea. The example demonstrates a problem stemming from the CMS architecture. Ideally, there should only be one URL.
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        /shoes/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        /shoes/fitness/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        In this case, where categories and subcategories appear to be constantly changing, the best URL to use is /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/. No other URLs should open this page. It's okay to add parameters to the URL. For example, the existence of the following URLs is okay if the canonical link tag is used.
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/?cat=shoes
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/?cat=shoes&subcat=fitness
        For each of the URLs above, what's called the canonical link tag should be added to the 
        <code> 
        <head> section of the page. The purpose of the canonical link tag is to tell search engines which version of a URL to index. As mentioned earlier, the version of the URL that we want to index is /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/. In this case, the canonical link tag should look like this on all 3 of the above URLs:
        <link href="http://www.example.com/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/" rel="canonical" >

        Side note: for tracking purposes, marketers need to add additional parameters to a URL. Those parameters should not be overridden and they should not cause the page to give a 404 error.
        CMS Features that help with SEO
        Since most websites use some sort of content management system, it means that the SEO specialist will need to rely on the CMS to help them modify website content to reach their objectives. Here are CMS capabilities that help with SEO:
        Ability to modify title tags and key meta data on all pages. That means the content that goes into the following areas:
        
       
        <title>{CONTENT}</title> (by default, use this: {Page Name} | {Company Name})
        <meta name="description" content="{CONTENT}" > (by default, leave this empty)
        <meta name="robots" content="{CONTENT}" > (by default, use index,follow)
        <link href="{CONTENT}" rel="canonical" >    (by default, match the URL of the page. So if the URL of the page is http://www.example.com/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/ then the canonical link tag should look like: <link href="http://www.example.com/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/ " rel="canonical" >
        Updating of the sitemap.xml file:
        The CMS should be able to generate a sitemap.xml file and place it in the root folder of the website (www.example.com/sitemap.xml). It should contain all main pages of the website and auto-update when new pages are added or some are removed. This is the format to follow:
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"> <url> <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc> <lastmod>2005-01-01</lastmod> </url> </urlset>
       
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>
        When a website contains multiple sections, for example a Wordpress-controlled blog, and some other self-contained sections, it may be easier to generate a separate sitemap for each section. These can be linked to using a sitemap index file, as seen in this example: https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/sitemap.xml
        Updating of the robots.txt file
        The robots.txt file controls where search engine crawlers are allowed to go. This file should be editable via the CMS. Magento has a list of subdirectories that should be disallowed by default that should be included from the start.
        Editable page sections
        Although it is not an SEO requirement, it is beneficial for tracking purposes to be able to edit various parts of all web pages on the website. These include:
        Immediately after the opening <head> tag. Immediately before the closing </head> tag. Immediately after the opening <body> tag. Immediately before the closing </body> tag.
        There are various tracking scripts that help in obtaining information about user behavior that need to be added to any of these areas. There should be a way to add a tag to all pages as well as each page individually.
        Image uploads
        When images are uploaded via the CMS, file names should be editable rather than being rewritten to a random string by the CMS. Image titles and alt tags should be editable (they usually are in most content management systems).
        Page speed
        To optimize page load time, various back-end load time cutting techniques should be employed, a long list of which can be found here: http://gtmetrix.com/recommendations.html. Pages should not take more than 3 seconds to load.
        404 configuration
        When a random URL is accessed, the server should return a 404 response - not a 302, 200 or any other.
