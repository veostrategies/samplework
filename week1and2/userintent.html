        How does machine learning in search work? 
    </p>
        
        <p>
        Before moving forward and thinking of machine learning we must understand how search engines crawl, and index websites. We must understand how search engine algorithms function. 
    </p>

        <p>
        Search engines treat user intent as ranking signals. We must know of their importance.

        What is user intent? 
        User Intent 
        
        User intent or query intent is the identification and categorization of what a user online intended or wanted when they typed their search terms into an online web search engine for the purpose of search engine optimization or conversion rate optimization. Also referenced at times as query intent. 
        
        How does machine learning actually impact search and seo? 
        
        We first must understand what Machine Learning is.
        
        Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.
        
        Machine learning is not the same as artificial intelligence (AI).
        
        AI is the science behind creating systems that resemble human-like intelligence and process information in a similar manner. AI is also unpredictable in many ways. Regarding SEO/VEO the AI will be able to add new data and calculate new techniques depending on what is required from the search engine. 
        
        We use machine learning to solve problems. Machine Learning works mathematically to produce the SEO techniques and solutions. 
        
        Google’s search engine’s primary algorithm is RankBrain.
        RankBrain is an algorithm learning artificial intelligence system, the use of which was confirmed by Google on 26 October 2015. It helps Google to process search results and provide more relevant search results for users.
        
        The machine learning aspect of RankBrain is what sets it apart from other updates. To “teach” the RankBrain algorithm to produce useful search results, Google first “feeds” it’s data from a variety of sources. The algorithm then takes it from there, calculating and teaching itself over time to match a variety of signals to a variety of results and to order search engine rankings based on these calculations.
