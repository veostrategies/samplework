Google’s core algorithm which uses machine learning (the ability of machines to teach themselves from data inputs) to determine the most relevant results to search engine queries. Pre-RankBrain, Google utilized its basic algorithm to determine which results to show for a given query. Post-RankBrain, it is believed that the query now goes through an interpretation model that can apply possible factors like the location of the searcher, personalization, and the words of the query to determine the searcher’s true intent. By discerning this true intent, Google can deliver more relevant results.

        How do we comply with Google’s RankBrain?
        
        Here are 4 ways for marketers to comply and win with RankBrain’s ranking system:
        
        RankBrain prefers natural long-tail keyword phrases, which sound like smartphone voice searches – or the real questions that searchers ask or seek. RankBrain connects the dots between the search terms and the keyword phrases to guide users to website content matching the search request. Marketers using long-tail queries as their keyword phrases get RankBrains’s attention. A clear, concise and conclusive keyword strategy with primary keywords and associated long-tail phrases and queries conveying the content topic, is easily interpreted by RankBrain, leading to a highly ranked website in SERP.

        2.  It is now advisable to use Google AdWords Keyword Planner – a valuable tool that identifies the exact and apt keyword phrases to build relevant content. It generates a list that a marketer will find helpful to review and determine the essential vital topics around which meaningful content can be created. Using these keyword phrase suggestions provided by Google can help in understanding how the search engine links the questions. Moreover, content with Google-suggested keyword phrases will get better RankBrain ranking.

        3. Create natural relevance  by writing unique, exciting and fact-based content that flows naturally and (yet strategically) with non-repetitive keywords and links that direct to complementary sources that enhance the idea and insights of the overall content. RankBrain loves content that is created keeping the user intent in mind - that the users will want to find in the websites.

        4. To own organic listings with remarkable click-through rates, it is imperative to tap into the readers’ emotions. Emotions are one of the most powerful triggers that not only increase the clickthrough rate but also boost the conversion rate dramatically. To raise your CTR from ‘OK’ to ‘Great,’ you must combine the best of both worlds – powerful and influential emotional trigger + relevant keyword strategy 
         RankBrain promotes content that is thoughtfully created answering users’ questions and solving their problems while leveraging a particular emotion.
        SEO is evolving each day, and AI and machine learning are adding new dimensions to what’s possible with search. Google has confirmed that RankBrain is continuously being applied to an increasing number of search queries and its AI processes all the questions that Google handles – which has humongous implications for your SEO strategy.

        Session Per User or Dwell Time (Time on-page)
        Bounce Rate (How quickly someone leaves)
